I started coding in 1982 in college. I have a thorough knowledge in the Microsoft domain, specifically in .NET technologies, SQL Server, and also in web technologies like AJAX, jQuery, Javascript and Google Maps.

I like to code efficiently and not just to get the job done. I strive to be on the cutting edge of technology so that I bring the best in the code I write. My goal is not to maintain the status quo but to improve upon what I have done, if possible. I respond quickly to any problems so that there is minimum downtime for clients.

By doing this, I help my company by designing websites and software that are user friendly and fast. This builds the reputation of the company and helps keep existing business and bring new business.
